\section{The Problem}

This paper will try to assess how well MC in practicly usable.
Wi want to know this about MC to find any room for improment in the language.





\subsection{MC}
the fact that there are very few strongly typed languages, stems from there complexity and unusability in most practical forms.

MC tries to be the first strongly typed language which is also practical.

MC is made to create other languages.
This might sound odd at first, but when you look at Lisp, it doesn't sound to strange.
Lisp has been made with the principle to do bottom up programming. \cite{onlisp}
Most experienced lisp programmers first create the language they need with lisp, afterwards they use this created language to program the actual program.

MC takes this quite litarely and wants to be a language to easily build compilers in.
It does this by using monads and monad transformers.
You can easily combine monads via monad transformers to create a parser monad.
A parser monad is quite adapt for parsing, hence its name.
MC uses it as a basis for the compilers we can build with it.

As of this moment the language is not yet complete and has no parser monad yet, but all the buildingblocks are there.

\paragraph{}
We first want to test if MC is a good language up to now. Then we can improve it to make it fit for the purpose it aims to be.

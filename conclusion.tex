\section{Conclusion}
So far we have learned what makes a programming language practically usable, how MC works and how practically usable MC is, in it's current state.

MC still needs some development before it has reached it's goal.
There is no complete compiler for MC itself and the StandardLibrary still needs some additions.
Mainly the parser monad.

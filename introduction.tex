\section{Introduction}

Meta-Casanova (from now on abriviated as MC) aims to be a strongly typed language to easily build compilers in.

Right now MC has no base of usage and has not been tested in any practical environment.
This means we have no way of knowing how practical MC actually is.
We will set up basic test criteria to find out how good MC is in a practical environment.
After which we explain MC in detail and put it to the test.
Our findings will then lead to a conclusion as to what state MC is in.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Firstly we explain why we want MC to be tested for it's practical use.
      Here we will find that MC has not been used in practical environments.
	\item Then we will explain on what criteria we will judge MC.
      These will be a general way of finding out if a programming language is any good.
	\item We will then dive into MC, explain the language, go over the criteria and see how it holds up.
      We will then find out what the sytax of MC looks like and how the language works.
	\item Lastly we will conclude how good and useful MC really is at this stage and how to proceed from here.
      This explains that MC still lacks some functionality compared to the criteria.

\end{enumerate}

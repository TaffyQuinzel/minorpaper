\chapter{Introduction}
\section{The problem}
Dr. Giuseppe Maggiore has developed a language specifically tailored for game development, called Casanova. To create this language he also created a language called MetaCompiler (MC). MC is a language which focuses itself on building compilers for other languages. This simplifies the creation of Casanova.

There are no languages that use a strong typesystem and are fast enough for computing heavy applications, such as games.

\section{My contributions}
I have worked on MC with the main purpose of testing the language's expressivity.

what did i do:
\begin{itemize}
\item standard library (ga langs alle dingin hierin
\item basic monads
\item started parser multiple times
\end{itemize}


fixing bugs
lift operator
understand the MC language
did a thing with F\# to learn more about functional programming


\chapter{my task}
my task was testing the expressivity of MC. Specifically ``can MC describe itself?''


hello will we rule something 
random things we will type
whole worlds will turn
i wonder where this comes from
superiority is not a gift
if it even is something real
